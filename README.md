ABB Search, includes:
  - ABB Scrapper
  - Goodreads search results
  - Anna's Archive search results

Overall comments:
  - code is pretty bad because I just hacked this arround with no goals of making something out of it
  - by default queries are cached to the disk, not compressed, takes a bit of space to scrap it all
  - Anna's Archive is rate limiting pretty hard since they give a big dump for all their data in torrent, but I don't have enough space to host it
  - search results are what they are, no garanties on the quality of the matches here
  - MeiliSearch is doing 99% of the work here, check them out <https://www.meilisearch.com/>
